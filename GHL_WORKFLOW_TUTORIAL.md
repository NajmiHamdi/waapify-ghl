## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issue 1: AI Doesn't Respond**
**Symptoms:** Workflow triggers but no WhatsApp message sent

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check GHL workflow logs ‚Üí Activities tab
2. Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
3. Test API key separately: https://platform.openai.com/playground
4. Check if keywords match the incoming message

**Fix:**
```
Replace AI action with test action first:
- Action: Send WhatsApp Text
- Message: "Test - workflow triggered successfully"
- If this works, issue is with AI configuration
```

### **Common Issue 2: Weird/Inappropriate Responses**
**Symptoms:** AI gives wrong answers or strange responses

**Debug Steps:**
1. Review business context - too vague?
2. Add negative examples in context
3. Test with different persona descriptions
4. Check if customer message contains unusual content

**Improved Context Example:**
```
GOOD Context:
"You are customer support for Mario's Restaurant.
ONLY answer questions about: hours, menu, reservations, location.
Hours: Mon-Sun 11AM-10PM
Location: 123 Main Street
DO NOT discuss: politics, other restaurants, personal topics.
If asked about topics outside restaurant business, say: 'I can only help with restaurant questions. What would you like to know about Mario's?'"

BAD Context:
"You help customers with restaurant stuff."
```

### **Common Issue 3: Slow Response Times**
**Symptoms:** Long delays before AI responds

**Optimize:**
1. Shorten business context (under 500 words)
2. Remove unnecessary workflow delays
3. Use gpt-3.5-turbo instead of gpt-4 for faster responses
4. Check OpenAI API status: https://status.openai.com

```
Condition: If {{trigger.message}} contains Spanish words
Then: AI with Spanish context

AI Context: "Previous conversation: {{contact.custom_fields.conversation_history}}"
```

### **Escalation Intelligence:**
```
AI Context: "If you cannot help or customer seems frustrated, respond with: 
'Let me connect you with our team for personalized assistance!' 
and use the phrase ESCALATE_NOW in your response."

Follow-up Condition: If AI response contains "ESCALATE_NOW"
Then: Create task for human agent + notify team
