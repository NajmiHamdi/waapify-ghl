# SMS Provider Configuration Fix

## Issue Identified
From DOCS_GHL.md analysis and testing, the problem is NOT with External Auth (it works correctly), but with SMS Provider configuration.

## Current Status
✅ External Auth endpoint working - responds correctly to credential submissions
✅ Database operations working - saves installations and configurations  
❌ SMS Provider not appearing in GHL Settings
❌ User reports black page after credential entry (but data actually saved)

## Root Cause
**SMS Provider Configuration Error** - According to GHL docs:

### For SMS Default Provider Replacement:
- ✅ Type: SMS
- ✅ Delivery URL: https://waaghl.waapify.com/webhook/provider-outbound  
- ❌ **"Is this a Custom Conversation Provider" MUST BE UNCHECKED**
- ❌ Enable as default SMS provider replacement

### Current Wrong Configuration (likely):
- Type: SMS
- Delivery URL: Correct
- ❌ "Is this a Custom Conversation Provider" = CHECKED (wrong!)
- Result: Appears as Custom Conversation Provider instead of SMS Provider

## Required Fix in GHL Marketplace
1. Edit the Conversation Provider in marketplace admin
2. **UNCHECK** "Is this a Custom Conversation Provider"  
3. Keep Type as "SMS"
4. Keep Delivery URL as current
5. This will make it appear as SMS Provider replacement

## After Fix
Users should see "Waapify" option in:
- Settings > Phone Numbers > Advanced Settings > SMS Provider
- NOT in Settings > Conversation Providers

## Test Plan
1. Fix marketplace SMS provider configuration
2. Install plugin in test GHL account
3. Check Settings > Phone Numbers > Advanced Settings > SMS Provider
4. Verify Waapify appears as SMS provider option
5. Test message sending through SMS workflow
